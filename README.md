# 3DNUS
## mtheall seems to be down; which means that 3DNUS can no longer be used. Sorry.

You're probably wondering why the Thread has been reduced down to this paragraph of
text; I'll tell you why.

Thanks everyone for supporting this project thus far. I appreciate everything that you all have said about this project. But, the reason I'm saying this is that I am stopping the project. Not just do to the mtheall servers being down, but also due to me being so focused on SimpliiU, and other side projects; as well as school. Again, thanks so much for your support. But, it seems like 3DNUS has come to an end. Either someone begins hosting a new mtheall service, or otherwise. Regardless, I will not be picking up the project back up. If this does happen, I fully condone you forking and making your own release(s) of 3DNUS. Thanks to @ground @VoxelStudios and so many more users and Tempers. Thanks again, and goodbye, 3DNUS.
