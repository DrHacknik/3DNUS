Welcome to 3DNUS;

This is a FREE to use Application, It is fully working.
The Current version you have is: Version 2.0.4(REV2) (Or 2.4.2).
3DNUS Allows you (The User) to download "3DS Firmwares/Titles" with ease.
If you wish to use them on a real 3DS (New Or OLD), Then please read the Tuto below.

Note: .NET 4.0 & Powerpack are required! 
As well as some .NET Redist Files (In the Folder Called "redist")


====================Tutorial=========================


To install ".cia" files Packed in 3DSNUS, perform the following:

1. Download (Using 3DNUS) a Firmware or Title; Ex: 4.0.0-3 (In FIRM Version Textbox);
In the Region Type "Your Region: USA/EUR/TWN/JPN/CHN", then click download; Also Select New 3DS or Old 3DS;
If the App freezes at any point, try a different version#.
Also make sure to tick "Pack as .CIA"

2. Now on your 3DS (With all .CIA's on SDCard), install the .CIA's like any other, 
but remember to do it on a EmuNAND (And Make A backup!).
Note: Downgrading is DANGEROUS!! Upgrading is a little less dangerous;
But remember, Im not responsable for any damage done to you 3DS, but i may help
you to fix your issue. Downgrading from 9.x ----> 4.x is possible but DANGEROUS!!;
6.x or 7.x ----> 4.x or 3.x is a little safer.

3.Reboot your System (While Crossing You Fingers); If it boot's your good to go!


4. Check your System Version!
