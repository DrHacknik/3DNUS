Welcome to 3DNUS;

This is a FREE to use Application, It is fully working.
The Current version you have is: Version 2.5.4.
3DNUS Allows you (The User) to download "3DS Firmwares/Titles" with ease.
If you wish to use them on a real 3DS (New Or OLD), Then please read the Tutorial below.

Note: .NET 4.1 & Powerpack are required! 
As well as some .NET Redist Files (In the Folder Called "redist")


***=================Installing Cia's======================***	
In order to install .cia's/.3ds/.3dsx/etc perform the Following;
Make a Folder Called "Package_Title" then place any .cia's/.3ds/.3dsx's.
To install them, go to "Virtual NAND Mode/Install/Title or Firmware,"
Then, a "Open File Dialog" will Open, Select the File in the "Package_Title" folder you
created. Then the Installer will Open. Due to some Minor Bugs, you'll need to Remove the File
Extension for Now! Ex: "00000.cia" needs to be "00000" instead. This makes sure the Package is Properly 
Installed. If there is an Error Saying "Title Already Installed!!," Then you'll need to Remove the VNM Folder;
(This is a Rare Error!), if it still fails, the Package may be Invalid or is Not Signed! Also, the "Package" File is 
Removed after the Install, which would be ".cia/3ds/3dsx" files. Make sure you Back-Up your Files Elsewhere;
(This May be Fixed Later).

***=================Tutorial======================***


To install ".cia" files Packed in 3DSNUS, perform the following:

1. Download (Using 3DNUS) a Firmware or Title; Ex: 4.0.0-3 (In FIRM Version Textbox);
In the Region Type "Your Region: USA/EUR/TWN/JPN/CHN", then click download; Also Select New 3DS or Old 3DS;
If the App freezes at any point, try a different version#.
Also make sure to tick "Pack as .CIA"

2. Now on your 3DS (With all .CIA's on SDCard), install the .CIA's like any other, 
but remember to do it on a EmuNAND (And Make A backup!).
Note: Downgrading is DANGEROUS!! Upgrading is a little less dangerous;
But remember, Im not responsable for any damage done to you 3DS, but i may help
you to fix your issue. Downgrading from 10.x ----> 4.x is possible but DANGEROUS!!;
6.x or 7.x ----> 4.x or 3.x is a little safer.

3.Reboot your System (While Crossing You Fingers); If it boot's your good to go!


4. Check your System Version!
